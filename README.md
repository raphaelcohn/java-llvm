## Known Issues

### Invalid Files

On Mac OS X, using all the jar files from JDK 1.8.0 update 74 (`rm -rf ./out/jar; mkdir -p ./out/jar; find /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_74.jdk/Contents/Home/ -type f -name '*.jar' | xargs gcp -t ./out/jar`), the following failures are present:-

* RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations length must match method descriptor parameter count
    * `rt.jar`
        * `com/sun/xml/internal/ws/binding/WebServiceFeatureList$MergedFeatures.class`
* bootstrap method argument reference is not a bootstrap method argument
    * `rt.jar`
        * `java/time/chrono/AbstractChronology.class`
        * and others; this looks like a real bug
