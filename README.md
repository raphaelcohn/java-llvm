On Mac OS X, using all the jar files from JDK 1.8.0 update 74 (`rm -rf ./out/jar; mkdir -p ./out/jar; find /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_74.jdk/Contents/Home/ -type f -name '*.jar' | xargs gcp -t ./out/jar`), all 73,669 files pass (although about 10 class files make use of String constants that have invalid UTF-16 surrogate pairs in them).
