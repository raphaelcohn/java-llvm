	@SuppressWarnings("SpellCheckingInspection")Usage(64), // The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
	DataError(65), // The input data was incorrect in some way. This should only be used for user's data and not system files.
	NoInput(66), // An input file (not a system file), did not exist or was not readable. This could also include errors like "No message" to a mailer (if it cared to catch it).
	NoUser(67), // The user specified did not exist. This might be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
	NoHost(68), // The host specified did not exist. This is used in mail addresses or network requests.
	Unavailable(69), // A service is unavailable. This can occur if a support program or file does not exist. This can also be used as a catchall message when something you wanted to do does not work, but you do not know why.

	IOError(74), // An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
	TemporaryFailure(75), // Temporary failure, indicating something that is not really an error. In sendmail, this means that a mailer (for example) could not create a connection, and the request should be reattempted later.
